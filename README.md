# Travel Planning Application

## Overview

This project is a travel planning application developed in C++ that calculates the shortest paths between locations using Dijkstra's algorithm. The application integrates advanced data structures like adjacency lists and priority queues to ensure efficient and accurate pathfinding.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths between locations.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Implements adjacency lists and priority queues to optimize the algorithm's performance.
- **Interactive Map**: (Note: This part was handled by other team members) Integrates with Google Maps API to visually display routes and provide an interactive user experience.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code files for the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and data structures.
- **include/**: Header files defining data structures and algorithm functions.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for validating the algorithm's correctness and performance.
- **docs/**: Documentation related to the project's design and implementation.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Google Maps API Key (for the map visualization part handled by other team members)
